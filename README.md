<h1>Hello, I am Matthew Davis.</h1>
I am a Computer and Information Technology student looking to utilize my skills in Internet Technologies. I have always been interested in how technology works from the interaction of hardware and software, to configuring different technologies as well as helping others set up their computer systems. I have foundational computer repair, troubleshooting, networking, and security knowledge, along with education and experience in using JavaScript, Python, HTML5/CSS, MySQL, and providing technical support.
<br/>
<br/>
In college, I have put forth the initiative and willingness to learn and grow from my courses. I have managed, organized, and led online group projects using Microsoft 365 and discussions involving programming and critical thinking. I have designed layouts, made wire-frames, and utilized JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the implementation of static websites. I have also used Python in a semester-long project to generate informational graphs with existing data on music therapy I gathered and organized into a spreadsheet.
<br/>
<br/>
With all that I have learned, I am currently working as an intern in Information Technology to gain more hands on training for supporting IT infrastructure and providing technology solutions for those working within it.
